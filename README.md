# ProcessingVSArduino

This is the final project in my master program. I used Porcessing to communicate with Arduino.


Project Description:
This project is divided into two parts. The first part is a visitor study to prove the hypothesis that interactive objects can attract more visitors and better engage them. A face-detection based system was used to automatically measure the interaction between visitor and object as well as to collect demographic visitor information.

The second part is a design intervention as a response to the findings from the first part of this project. A new way of displaying museum objects was proposed as an alternative to the conventional museum display. A mechanical laser pointer is used as a guide to help visitors understand objects. At the same time information about the object is presented on a screen. This solution provides an opportunity for the museum curator to build a story based on their knowledge. Finally, the same evaluation method would be conducted to evaluate this new solution.
